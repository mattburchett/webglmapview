  "body": "# Mapview WebGL\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nThis is an attempt to throw together a webGL version of the Mapview program (located [here](http://atsnavmap.startreklover.com/)) so that folks that have a Mac or other Non-Windows machine can still have a map of the game. \r\n\r\nThis is project is by no means official or complete. It is simply ment as a POC at this point. If there is enough interest in this game-side I may continue to develop it to be a fairly complete alternative to the MapView software. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contributing & Comments\r\n\r\nFeel free. I am not a JS developer by any stretch (no really, just look at the code. Frightning) so any desire to contribute or any desire to blast me and call me an idiot for doing X, Y or Z, go for it. I'm only trying to learn. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
